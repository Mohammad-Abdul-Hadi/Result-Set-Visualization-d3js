# Result_Set_Visualization_d3js_interactive_tree

We developed an interactive dynamic tree where each nodes{leaves} in the first, second and third layer represent different models, feature, and result-data (accuracy, F1-score, run time) respectively. can be dragged, zoomed and panned.This was developed so that developers may traverse through the result data set with ease
